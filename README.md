## Carol, as your team lead
Hi there! I’m so excited to be working with you :) My main goal as your team lead is to help you grow in your career, support you in your role and ensure you’re a happy, high performing team member above all else. In this document, I’ve decided to share what you can expect from me as a team lead and my work style. This is a great ice breaker to help you to get to know me better—it doesn’t substitute 1:1s and communicating on a regular basis to get to know each other better.

## Communication
I really appreciate transparent communication, but sometimes, I have a hard time finding the right words to explain something. I am not a native English speaker but I am actively working on improving my language skills. So if I say something weird or misuse a word, please let me know as I appreciate your feedback to help me improve (think of it like I have spinach in my teeth!). 

I like to be clear and transparent about anything happening inside of a project by keeping the lines of communication open on Slack or in meetings. This means sharing updates on things I’m working on, knowing what my team members are working on so we can support each other, and ensuring we are all working towards the same goal (and within the same timeline). If you have ideas or suggestions that might help with things I’m working on, I’d prefer to chat about it privately (instead of in public channels/places) to hear what you have to say and to live our core value of *Passionately Debate* by deliberating the best solution. When sharing ideas or offering help, it’s helpful for me if they are delivered as suggestions or options rather than directions of what I need to do. Otherwise, it makes me feel like I don’t have the skills or abilities to solve the problem. I’ll do the same when I am looking to share ideas or offer help to others like yourself!

## Feedback

**I LOVE FEEDBACK**! It helps me to learn and grow and shows you care about me. At Thinkific, we use 7Geese for recognition. I will do my best to acknowledge your accomplishments, big and small and encourage you to do the same for others. I like giving and receiving recognition publicly and privately, since it makes people feel good so why not do more of it? Recognition can be as simple as saying ‘thank you’ or ‘I appreciate your help with _____’. 

We practice **Radical Candor** here, so if you aren’t familiar with it, here’s a great video to give you an overview: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yODalLQ2lM

Radical Candor is about caring personally and challenging directly. Please don’t be afraid to share your feedback with me in a timely and considerate manner. My goal is to give you feedback early and often, both positive and constructive, with a clear explanation for the ‘why’ behind it so you understand how you can learn and grow. I prefer constructive feedback to happen in a 1-1 meeting between you and I, ideally face to face (or a call) instead of over Slack. It’s helpful for me to know what the situation was or where I can improve, the type of impact it had and for us to work together to identify how I/we can improve. If you’re not sure how it’ll be received, I find starting with ‘Hey, can I give you some feedback?’ is an easy opener to set the expectation for the chat. I will try to assume positive intent in every situation, even if the impact may not have been received as intended and encourage you to do the same. I believe sharing is caring so my goal is to ultimately share my experiences with you so we can work better, together. If you feel offended or disrespected at anytime, sharing it in a timely manner is important, and I will do the same whether that is talking about it right away, or finding a later time to connect face to face or on a call.

If I share feedback with you, I will feel discouraged and will have a hard time reaching out to give you feedback if it seems like you don’t care. You may not always agree with me, and I’d love to have a dialogue to understand your perspective so I can also learn from it. I think it is important to show acknowledgement and appreciation when feedback is shared with me and hope you will do the same—It’s so rewarding for me to see the feedback I share having an impact (i.e., Thanks for the great suggestion, it helped me with X).

## My passion
I really love to talk about software development processes, so if you're not happy with current team processes or have feedback about it, please let me know! I believe in taking a solutions-based approach to problems, so if you have feedback about our processes, please come prepared with solutions instead of just complaints. I would be excited to chat with you about processes so that we can work together to find a better way of building things!

## Leadership
As a team lead, my role is to guide and support **you and other members** of my team by:

 - Providing context to problems, challenges and the work we are doing so you and others on the team can be successful
 - Connecting the dots between company goals and your personal goals for career growth
 - Mentoring team members on our technologies, best practices and sharing my insider knowledge on our business/industry
 - Being available to support team members and answer questions

## 1:1s
1:1s are our dedicated time and place to talk about you! Let me know how I can best support you in your role or any challenges/blockers I can help remove—ask me anything and everything! This time should be used to share what you are working on, ask for guidance or clarification, to request or give feedback, or to talk about things we should start/stop/keep doing.

I have a few suggestions on how to have a good 1:1:
 - Jump into your 1:1 in 7Geese and take notes throughout the month about things you’d like to discuss. It is difficult to remember everything that happened in one month!
 - List examples when possible so I have context to any issues or challenges you’re facing
 -  You are guiding the conversation. I might have things to mention, but it’s all about what you need. If you haven’t done a 1:1 before or don’t know what to talk about, I recommend reading [How to Prepare for a One-on-One Meeting as an Employee](https://knowyourteam.com/blog/2018/01/03/7-ways-to-prepare-for-an-effective-one-on-one-meeting-with-your-manager/)
 - Important topics should not wait for a 1:1. Send me a Slack message and we can arrange to talk as soon as possible!
 - Don’t be shy! I hope you’ll feel comfortable being open, honest and authentic in our 1:1 meetings and I will do the same. If at any point you feel differently, please let me know ASAP. 

## Personal Quirks

I am usually available and in the office between 9:15 AM and 5PM. You will know via the Work From Home calendar if I am working from home (usually on Thursdays). We have a flexible WFH policy, so if you are planning to work from home (whether it’s recurring or a one-off), please let our team know in advance and keep your calendar up to date so the entire team will know you aren’t around. I really value being on time and showing up for important meetings—we are flexible about when/where you work but attending events like Town Halls and Stand-ups shouldn’t be optional. I encourage you to be present and show up on time unless you have a legitimate reason not to, in which case I’d ask you to let me know so we are on the same page. 

I like to be kept in the know for projects I’m involved with to make sure no one is blocked and to ensure the project is on track based on our deadlines. I tend to be an overcommunicater to avoid missing information and like to ask questions to get the full picture, so if you ever feel micromanaged, know that it’s not my intention. Please let me know right away if you ever feel that way!

I work with headphones because it helps me to concentrate and I like to listen to music/podcasts. If you need to talk to me, send me a Slack message or tap me on my shoulders to get my attention. I may not have all the answers that you need—sometimes I will need to dig into the codebase or go for a walk to think through and give you a better answer, but know I will do my best to get you the answers you need (even if it may be from someone else). If you need help with a specific issue, please provide me with context on the issue you’re facing and share solutions that you already tried (or want to try) so I can help you in the best way possible.

## About me

Some random facts:
- I wrote my first lines of code when I was 13, while messing around on blogs source code. 
- I built a "website" about Green Day *(yep, the band)* as my English project in the 8th grade because I  didn’t like to present with written papers
- I am from the south of Brazil, so my favorite foods are all German and Italian due to the immigration in that area :)
- I have a lovely dog called Sugar [@sugartheformosandog](https://www.instagram.com/sugartheformosandog/).
- I have a hard time with public speaking, but I am forcing myself to do it more to get better! 
- I really believe in a world where equality persists for all human beings (in other words, I am a **feminist** with all my soul)
- I created the hashtag [#ThinkSheCoded](https://dev.to/t/thinkshecoded) for myself and other team members to share our experiences as women in tech
